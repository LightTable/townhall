A place to discuss, raise issues and help grow LightTable as a community.

## Have a feature which you desperately want in your editor?
Create a [new issue](https://github.com/LightTable/townhall/issues/new), discuss your feature request and aid in the development. You'll be amazed how, easy it was to request
and get.

## Have a problem with current LightTable and want to discuss it?
It is better to discuss that in Issues but can also, discuss it in [Gitter](https://gitter.im/LightTable/LightTable).
